This shows how to sprinkle some lightweight javascript into a server-side
JVM/clojure ring application, using
[squint-cljs](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint).

The squint js dependencies only add ~20K (~8K compressed), so this is great for web
pages designed for mobile apps, for example.

To run:

```
$ bb run
```
